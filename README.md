## Admin React App(created for [streaming-app](https://github.com/codesagecoder/sreaming-app))
This is a very simple admin dashboard to upload new content, manage content, and view analytics.

## How to run the App
#### Must have nodejs with npm installed (preferrably latest version).
1. Download/clone the repository and open the folder in the cli
2. Insall all the dependencies using `npm i` command
3. Launch the server with `npm start` command. The app will launch on localhost:3000 automatically.

## Dependencies
- nodejs
- react
- firebase
- axios
- recharts

## Really Important
This project is only a simple react app which was not intended to be a full scale admin application therefore it is lacking a lot of features. I only created the important features which I considered necessary for it's own basic functionality which is to only serve a purpose for the [streaming-app](https://github.com/codesagecoder/sreaming-app). It is not even fully optimized to be used on mobile devices.
